** Software skills in this program: **
-Using STL of <vector>, <stack>, <algorithm>.
-Using polymorphism: in OutputInstructions.h and OutputInstructions.cpp files, both class OutputInstructionsToFile and class OutputInstructionsToScreen inherit from class BaseOutput. WriteAcceptedOrder() and WriteRejectedOrder() are two pure virtual functions.
-.txt file creation, open, close, read and write.

** Source Code Explanation **
-FishAndChips.h/FishAndChips.cpp: include main entry function and main process of this application.
